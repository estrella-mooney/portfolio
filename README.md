## Hey and Welcome to my portfolio :) 🧚🏻🐝🌞

In crafting this portfolio, I had two primary objectives: to refine the web development abilities I learned through Dev Academy Aotearoa, and to have fun experimenting with new technologies. To accomplish this, I decided to dive into the Next js react framework.

## Tech used 
* TypeScript
* React.js
* Next.js
* TailWind CSS
* SCSS
* Vercel (deployment)
